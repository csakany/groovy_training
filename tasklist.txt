Practice note: Each script concludes with a "Practice Task" comment that reinforces the listed helpers.

1 - Welcome new hire & demonstrate dynamic typing (getProperty, toBoolean, setScale, setBody)
2 - Format badge text with string helpers (split, findAll, collect, toUpperCase)
3 - Calculate payroll adjustments with BigDecimal (as BigDecimal, setScale, arithmetic operators)
4 - Evaluate promotions with conditional logic (getProperty, as Integer, Elvis/ternary operators)
5 - Classify HR training progress via switch ranges (switch, range cases, setProperty)
6 - Coordinate orientation rosters using loops (split, StringBuilder.append, while/size)
7 - Filter training sessions with collection helpers (split, equalsIgnoreCase, findAll, each)
8 - Summarize attendance totals and averages (collect casts, sum, size, String.format)
9 - Validate raise requests with try/catch/finally (as BigDecimal, try/catch/finally, setProperty)
10 - Summarize role updates with reusable methods (buildSummary/applyRaise, default params, with, setScale)
11 - Parse score properties safely (as Integer, ternary operator, try/catch/finally)
12 - Personalize greetings with closures (closure syntax, collect, join)
13 - Spotlight HR teams via filtered employee lists (closure filters, findAll, collect, join)
14 - Manage onboarding course lists (leftShift, remove/add, join, size)
15 - Adjust department headcounts in maps (property access, bracket notation, collect, join)
16 - Build a training schedule from ranges (range literal, collect, join)
17 - Bundle employee data into a profile class (map constructor, getClass().simpleName)
18 - Apply raises with regex validation (applyRaise, regex ==~, map constructor)
19 - Demonstrate inheritance for team leads (override introduce, super, StringBuilder.append)
20 - Contrast abstract staff member roles (abstract role(), overrides, join)
21 - Parse manager details from XML with XmlSlurper (parseText, dot navigation, text())
22 - Compare XmlSlurper and XmlParser outputs (parseText, getClass().simpleName, text())
23 - Build an employee directory XML via MarkupBuilder (StringWriter, MarkupBuilder, eachWithIndex)
24 - Remove inactive employee nodes from XML (XmlParser, findAll/remove, XmlUtil.serialize)
25 - Parse employee JSON for salary adjustments (JsonSlurper.parseText, JsonOutput.prettyPrint, setScale)
26 - Log headers and create CPI attachments (getHeaders, addAttachmentAsString, setStringProperty)
27 - Supply a reusable mapping function for names (buildDisplayName, collect trim, join)
28 - Sort employee data with custom comparators (sort comparator, spaceship operator, join)
29 - Retrieve value-mapping entries via CPI API (getMappedValue, safe navigation, setProperty)
30 - Delay processing and enrich XML payloads (sleep, XmlSlurper, appendNode/replaceBody, XmlUtil.serialize)
