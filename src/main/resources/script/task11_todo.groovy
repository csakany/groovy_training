    Practice Task 11: Add safe parsing with try/catch.
    - Read an engagement score (or similar metric) from properties.
    - Attempt to convert it to an Integer and branch on the value; fall back gracefully if parsing fails.
    - Mirror the demo by recording both the raw entry and a helpful note as properties.
    Next step: Replace the TODO with your own exception handling code.
