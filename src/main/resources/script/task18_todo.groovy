    Practice Task 18: Add behavior and validation to a class.
    - Create a PracticePayrollEmployee class with salary and payrollId fields.
    - Implement a method to increase the salary and another that validates the payrollId with the same regex pattern as the demo.
    - Only apply the raise when the ID matches the expected format and store both outcomes as properties.
    Next step: Update the salary and property values after performing the validation.
