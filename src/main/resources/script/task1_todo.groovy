    Practice Task 1: Welcome a teammate while inspecting their data types.
    - Read the employee name, department, ID, salary, and active status from message properties.
    - Build a short summary that uses string interpolation and shows the Groovy types you converted to.
    - Store any helpful extra property values such as uppercase department, name length, or detected type names.
    - Keep the focus on the same functions used in the demonstration (property access, casting, and string formatting).
    Next step: Follow the reminders above and replace the TODO with your own implementation.
