    - Read a useful header (for example X-CorrelationId) from the message.
    - If a messageLogFactory is available, add the body as an attachment and record the header as a string property.
    - Store whether an attachment was created and echo the header in the body like the demo.
    Next step: Replace the TODO with your own monitoring logic.
