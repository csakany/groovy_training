    - Apply the same control structures from the demo to decide between promotion, mentoring, or improvement steps.
    - Add a ternary expression for an additional message property that highlights any fast-track situations.
    - Keep the TODO focused on the same Groovy flow constructs demonstrated.
    Next step: Replace the TODO with your own branching logic.
